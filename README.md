## Decentralized File System For Blockchain Peer To Peer Nodes

This project aims to create a decentralized type of file system that may be __hosted in an unknown location__ so it won't have a centralized point of access, __distributed__ along the internet for faster access, __strongly encrypted__ so it can limit its access to the specific restrictions allowed by its owners. 

The concept would start by using the already existing network of file storage (cloud and local), and also the already existing encryption/decryption models and protocols, and publically allow the usage by full blockchain wallets to encapsulate the data to be transfered to those "public" storages and access them as a standard node for the blockchain network. The challenge will be to have the permission provided by the public for those storages areas and share the usage in an intelligent manner by allocating the space only on the areas where its not being used (wasted free space).
